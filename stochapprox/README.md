### Late Policy and Academic Honesty
All assignments and exams are individual, except when collaboration is explicitly allowed. All the sources used for problem solution must be acknowledged, e.g. web sites, books, research papers, personal communication with people, etc. Academic honesty is taken seriously; for detailed information see https://www.deanofstudents.ualberta.ca/en/AcademicIntegrity.aspx.
