### Course Objective
The course objective is to study the analysis of stochastic approximation algorithms from the viewpoint of dynamical systems.

### Prerequisites
Linear Algebra, Probability

We will cover the needed background, from the beginning (real analysis, probability theory, stochastic processes) to make these topics accessible. The goal of the courses is Fundamentals of Stochastic Approximation Theory, rather than Advanced topics. 

### Textbooks
Stochastic Approximation: A Dynamical Systems Viewpoint, Vivek S. Borkar.

**Recommended supplements**

Stochastic Approximation and Recursive Algorithms and Applications. George Yin and Harold J. Kushner 

### Grading
* Presentations: 20% 
* Initial draft for project: 30% 
* Final project write-up: 50%

 
### Topics:

* Real Analysis - Real numbers, topology, sequences, compact sets, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integraton.
* Probability Theory - Borel set, probability measure, expectation, convergence theorems, L-p spaces, Radon-Nikodyn theorem
* Stochastic process - Conditional expectation, stochastic processes, Kolmogorov extension theorem, martingales, martingale convergence                         theorems    
* Dynamical systems - ODE local existence and uniqueness theorems, stability, linear dynamical systems.
* Stochastic approximation algorithms - Chapter 2, 3,   6 and 4 of Borkar's textbook.
